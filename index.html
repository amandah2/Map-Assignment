      The New York State Department of Labor released its most recent unemployment data that shows New York City’s unemployment rate is still higher than the country and surrounding suburbs including Westchester and Long Island. The city's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 9.4% in October 2021, a drop of 0.4% from the previous month and a decrease of 2.6% from October 2020. While the unemployment rate in the United States is far lower at 4.2%.

The Bronx has the highest unemployment rate (11.7%) out of all the five boroughs and the highest of all counties in NYS. Fabián Wander, Health and Wellness Director at Hostos Community College in the South Bronx saw this rise in unemployment since the pandemic first hand with how it impacted the college’s student body. “A lot of them [Hostos Community College students] were working part-time jobs. They were in the service industry. Many of them were Uber drivers. So all of these things kind of took a hit when the pandemic came and the hours or decrease they lost their job and they were really struggling financially,” said Wander.

NYC took a significant hit during the pandemic specifically in some of its strongest industries including tourism, retail, service, and hospitality. The city’s unemployment rate peaked in June 2020 at 20%. Surrounding suburban counties like Westchester and Suffolk have similar unemployment rates to the rest of the country at 4.2% and 4%, respectively.
